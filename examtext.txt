3.1 Calculate the time taken by ball A to return to the ground.  (4)
3.2 Sketch a velocity-time graph for ball A.
Show the following on the graph:
(a) Initial velocity of ball A
(b) Time taken to reach the highest point of the motion
(c) Time taken to return to the ground (3)

ONE SECOND after ball A is projected upwards, a second ball, B, is thrown vertically   -1 downwards at a velocity of 9 m∙s
from a balcony 30 m above the ground.
Refer to the diagram below.   B  -1  9 m∙s   30 m   -1 16 m∙s
A ground   3.3 Calculate how high above the ground ball A will be at the instant the two balls  pass each other. (6)    [13]
